1.  Yo name.
    Literally, put your first name as the solution in the first row.

2.  After the Hashtag Bandit's campaign last winter, two camps of hashtag  users
    have formed.  There's 'The Conscious Conservatives' who adhere to a strictly
    no-hyphens-in-hashtags policy (as you  can  see,  they  are  avid  users  of
    hyphens in policy names, though). The other camp of hashtag users take every
    opportunity they get to spice up their lives with word-separating horizontal
    lines, and call themselves 'The Hardcore Hypheneers'.
    The Hashtag Bandit wants to find out the effects  of  his  campaigning,  and
    has hired you to do some research for him.  He wants to know  which  of  the
    camps have the most (and the most active)  followers.   He  has  compiled  a
    list  of  recent  social  media  content  for  you,  and   wants   to   know
    whether  there  are  more  hyphen-containing  or  hyphenless  hashtags   out
    there.    Find   the   list   at   https://hack.stianj.com/marijuanatags.txt
    The answer is the most popular group's acronym.

3.  Yes,  there is text in this picture,  but the important word is not the  one
    you see. https://hack.stianj.com/message.gif
    Oh,  and the hidden message  is not the solution.  It's the location of  the
    answer.

4.  Enrique McEmoji wanted  to  send  his  friends  an  emoji  to  describe  his
    financial status after winning in  a  casino.   Unfortunately,  all  of  his
    friends are hardcore Apple fanboys and use iPhones.  Enrique, on  the  other
    hand, has created his own smart phone out of an  old  TI-84  calculator  and
    some gum,  running  his  own  operating  system  called  OSOS  (open  source
    operating system).  For emoji support, he's chosen to use Emoji One 2.1,  an
    open source collection of images following the unicode  specification.   The
    problem occured when he sent the 'Slot Machine' emoji (U+1F3B0).  While  all
    his friends saw three red colored digits in the emoji  they  received,  this
    was not the colors of the emoji he  had  sent.   Can  you  describe  to  the
    unfortunate iPhone users which colors Enrique saw when sending the emoji, by
    telling them which country's flag they resemble?  (Because of a  programming
    error in OSOS, the image on his screen is flipped horizontally, but  Enrique
    doesn't mind, since he can read backwards anyway).

5.  The source code of  a  famous  demo  group's  internal demo  tool   has some
    controversial meanings about certain people.  Specifically, people  using  a
    tool of the hypertext markup language precompiler  variety.   Unfortunately,
    this precompiler device  was  only  used  in  very  early  versions  of  the
    software, so you'll have to do some digging to find it.  What was the source
    code's verdict on people using this precompilation  tool?   That  is,  which
    adjective was used to describe this species?

6.  Many animals keep their unborn children warm by  sleeping  on  top  of  them
    [citation   needed].    Now,   this   one   guy    called    Farmster    von
    Animalsterville  is  breeding  some  kind  of  weird  looking   paper-shaped
    species.  Last night, he got a group of four human slaves to sleep on top of
    them.  He'd like you to find  the  animals,  and  report  back  their  names
    (for efficiency, all of them  have  one-letter  names).   Report  the  names
    ordered by the age of  the  humans  that  kept  each  of  them  warm  during
    the  night,  from  oldest  to  youngest.

7.  Not everything is actually what it looks like.  Get rid  of  all  the  phony
    stuff, and what remains is your answer.

8.  Simon Sceneman has  created  a  cool  demo  on  a  semi-popular  tweet-sized
    demo website.  For a demo created by someone whose last name  is  'Sceneman'
    it's not very good, to be honest.  Anyway, go find it  and  then  come  back
    here.
    You're back?  Good.  Now run up to the main road, and find  the  thing  that
    looks like what you saw in the demo. Below it is a sign. The answer you're
    looking for is the second word on that sign.

9.  The first column contains vital information, but you'll need to use the next
    columns to reorder the lines in the correct order. The important information
    is written in an  unknown  language  so  you'll  just  have  to  trust  your
    instincts that you found the correct word.  It'll only be used as a  nuclear
    bomb launch  code,  so  it's  okay  if  you  don't  get  it  exactly  right.
