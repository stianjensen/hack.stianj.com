# Hints
===============================

General: Remember that all letters in the solution are lower case.

1. Your name. Your FIRST name.
   If there's not enough space for your whole name in this exercise, it's okay.
   Only the first part is important for the final solution.

2. Don't count the number of hyphens in hashtags. Count the number of tweets with
   hashtags containing hyphens.
   Because: note that not all hashtags consist of multiple words.  You can regard a
   tweet as being written by a hyphen entusiast as long as  it  contains  at  least
   one hashtag with hyphens.

3. The message is compressed, somehow.
   And only half the file is an image \o/

4. Find images of emojis for each platform, not just the default unicode version.

6. If you need help deducing which slaves were guarding which animal,
   ask the judge.
   "Paper-shaped species" means they are actually just pieces of paper with writing
   on them.

8. The website is of course http://dwitter.lionleaf.org
   You should really be able to figure out the correct username and dweet yourself.

9. Use the letters in the other columns to reorder the lines.
   The last sentence is irony. You need to get it right.
